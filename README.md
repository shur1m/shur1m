I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Santa Clara University.
I also work as a freelance translator online for Japanese novels and comics.
Coding and Japanese Language are my two main passions. 
I hope you find what's in here interesting!

### LeetCode Stats

While preparing for interviews, I became more interested in algorithms than I thought I would be. Here are my LeetCode stats:

### The Goods
I've pinned some of my projects below. The [Sakura Paris API](https://github.com/shur1m/sakuraParisPythonAPI) allows easy access to around 40 Japanese dictionaries using Python. [One Brain Cell](https://github.com/shur1m/one_brain_cell) is a mobile app written with Flutter that allows you to easily create and review spaced repitition flashcards for learning almost anything. I've also played around with Discord bots using Node.js, and made one for scheduling messages and one for parsing Yomichan dictionaries. Unfortunately I can't pay for servers to host them, but feel free to host them yourself if you would like to try them out.

### What I'm currently working on
Check out the sleek UI for the [Flutter app](https://github.com/shur1m/one_brain_cell) I'm working on. It features a folder system, a heatmap for your progress, and an SQLite database for all your flashcards. The app isn't fully functioning as of now, but it will be! I hope to implement features like customizable SRS and automated card creation. Ignore the fact that the lyrics in the second screenshot are out of order, I was testing reordering them haha.
