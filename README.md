Hello, I'm Shurim (Anson Xu), currently a Computer Science and Engineering student at Santa Clara University.
In case you've seen my name somewhere else before, I also work as a freelance translator online for Japanese novels and comics 
Coding and Japanese Language are my two main passions. 
I hope you find what's in here interesting!
