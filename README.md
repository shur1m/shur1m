I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Santa Clara University.
I also work as a freelance translator online for Japanese novels and comics.
Coding and Japanese Language are my two main passions. 
I hope you find what's in here interesting!

### LeetCode Stats

While preparing for interviews, I became more interested in algorithms than I thought I would be. Here are my LeetCode stats:

### The Goods
I've pinned some of my projects below. One that (I think) is pretty cool is the [Sakura Paris API](https://github.com/shur1m/sakuraParisPythonAPI), which allows easy access to around 40 monolingual Japanese dictionaries. I've also played around with Discord bots using Node.js, and made one for scheduling messages and one for parsing Yomichan dictionaries. Unfortunately I can't pay for servers to host them, but you can host them yourself if you find them useful.
