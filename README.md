I am a Computer Science and Engineering student at Santa Clara University.
I also work as a freelance translator online for Japanese novels and comics.
Coding and Japanese Language are my two main passions. 
I hope you find what's in here interesting!

### Scripts
[Convert Schwab Bank transaction JSONs to QIF](https://gist.github.com/shur1m/7127a049384a0bcfe57c24bc3f2f1b69)

### Projects
I've pinned some of my projects below. The [Sakura Paris API](https://github.com/shur1m/sakuraParisPythonAPI) allows easy access to around 40 Japanese dictionaries using Python. [One Brain Cell](https://github.com/shur1m/one_brain_cell) is a mobile app written with Flutter that allows you to easily create and review spaced repetition flashcards for learning almost anything. I've also written with Discord bots using Node.js, and made one for scheduling messages and one for parsing Yomichan dictionaries. Unfortunately I can't pay for servers to host them, but feel free to host them yourself if you would like to try them out.
